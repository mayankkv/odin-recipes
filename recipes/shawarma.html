        <h2>Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish made with marinated meat (often chicken or beef) that is roasted on a spit and 
            served in a pita bread wrap with vegetables and sauces.</h2>
        <p>
            Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish that has gained worldwide popularity. It is typically made with marinated 
            meat (chicken, beef, or lamb) that is slowly roasted on a spit, resulting in tender and juicy meat with a crispy 
            exterior. The meat is then sliced off the spit and served in a warm pita bread wrap with fresh vegetables (lettuce, 
            tomatoes, onions) and sauces (tahini, hummus, garlic sauce). Shawarma can be found in various versions and styles 
            across the Middle East, and it is often served as a fast-food item or street food. It has become a favorite food 
            for many, thanks to its delicious taste and convenient packaging.
