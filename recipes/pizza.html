        <h2>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a flat, round base of dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various 
            ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and herbs.</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza is a popular Italian dish that has become a global favorite. It typically consists of a round, flat base of 
            dough made from wheat flour and yeast, which is then topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various ingredients such 
            as meats (pepperoni, sausage, bacon), vegetables (mushrooms, onions, bell peppers), herbs (basil, oregano), and other 
            toppings (olives, anchovies, pineapple). The pizza is then baked in an oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese 
            is melted and bubbly. Pizza is enjoyed in many different styles around the world, with variations such as deep-dish, 
            thin-crust, and stuffed crust. It is often served as a fast-food item or delivered to homes, and it is a beloved 
            comfort food for many people.

            <li><b>Add the cheese: </b>Sprinkle the grated or sliced cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
            <li><b>Add the toppings: </b>Add your desired toppings on top of the cheese, spreading them out evenly.</li>
            <li><b>Bake the pizza: </b>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake it for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden 
                brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li><b>Slice and serve: </b>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing it into wedges and serving hot.</li>
